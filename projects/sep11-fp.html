            <p><br>Context</br>
                The SEP11 freedom project is a project where 11th graders use javascript and a tool of their own to create anything interactive. We have the freedom to create games, music, or just anything informational with the use of javascript and their free learning tool. My partner Angela and I decided to work together to create a game with background music so the game won't be too boring with no sound. I decided to create the background music and my partner mainly focuses on making the game. I then help my partner with learning her tool. </p>
            <p><br>Content</br>
                For my project, I chose to independently study EarSketch and kaboom in order to help me make Dodger. Dodger is a game that's created using kaboom.js with background music and sounds made using earsketch. I mainly focused on the tool EarSketch to create sounds for the game while Angela mainly focused on making the game itself. I also tried to help Angela with Kaboom by trying to figure out the codes Angela is stuck on. Using EarSketch, we were able to have a background music for the game, along with a coin collecting and a failing sound. Using Kaboom, Angela was able to create the whole game where the player can be moved using the arrow keys, jump/double jump with the space key, to collect coins and dodge the eggs. This is a fun game to improve your reflexes and to just have fun. </p>
            <p><br>Reflection</br>
                Angela and I have been partners for other projects too and we worked well together because we communicated well. For this reason, I believe that communication is really important since without communication, we wouldn't have been able to practice our presentations and communicate on what we need help with. However, we are both procrastinators so we sometimes end up leaving our project to finish up last minute but of course we didn't finish in time. This teaches me that time management is also really important because finishing everything on time will give us more time to go beyond MVP and create a better game, but we were only able to finish our MVP. We got an honorable mention, but we might've gotten into top 3 if we went beyond MVP. This is why I'll choose to finish everything before due date next time so I'll have more time to check my work and improve later on. </p>
