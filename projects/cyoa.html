            <h1 class="margin text-center">Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
            <p>I was able to choose an adventure and make up a story plot with my partner. The title of our adventure is called, "Life as a Lucky guy." We created this webpage using html and css we learned over the course of one semester.</p>
            <p>We made an adventure webpage on what it's like to live a lucky life. We both agree that lucky people win money in any way possible. We found ways to make it seem like a normal day can turn out to be a lucky day. There are so many possiblilities in life where you can win money in any way. You can find money and keep it, or give it to the police and get money for being a kind person, who knows?</p>
            <p>Mr. Mueller gave us this project to do in order to collaborate with new people, create merge conflicts, and find ways to fix these conflicts. This is so we can have some experience with collaborating with new, and eventually more people. Some challenges I faced were disagreements on what the plot should be. There was a part where my partner wanted to write how the person is going to go over to the friends' house but I believe that it's the friend that should come over. The problem was fixed by him leaving it as what I had written. If I were to do this again, I would get his contact in order to text him and tell him what to do so he can contribute more and we can get more done. I would try to come up with more creative ideas and make my page more appealing if I had more time. </p>
